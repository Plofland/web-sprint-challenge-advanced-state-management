# Advanced State Management Sprint Challenge

**Read these instructions carefully. Understand exactly what is expected _before_ starting this Sprint Challenge.**

This challenge allows you to practice the concepts and techniques learned over the past sprint and apply them in a concrete project. This sprint explored **advanced state management**. During this sprint, you studied **the reducer pattern, and redux**. In your challenge this week, you will demonstrate your mastery of these skills by creating the **Smurf Village Database**!

This is an individual assessment. All work must be your own. Your challenge score is a measure of your ability to work independently using the material covered through this sprint. You need to demonstrate proficiency in the concepts and objectives introduced and practiced in preceding days.

You are not allowed to collaborate during the sprint challenge. However, you are encouraged to follow the twenty-minute rule and seek support from your TL if you need direction.

_You have **three hours** to complete this challenge. Plan your time accordingly._

## Introduction

In this challenge, you are to build a Smurfs village database utilizing Redux as your state management system. Build this challenge from the ground up using what you have learned about state management.

### Commits

Commit your code regularly and meaningfully. This helps both you (in case you ever need to return to old code for any number of reasons) and your team lead as the evaluate your solution.

## Interview Questions

Be prepared to demonstrate your understanding of this week's concepts by answering questions on the following topics. You might prepare by writing down your own answers before hand.

1. What problem does the context API help solve?
   ---> Context API is a way to share values (state, functions, data, etc.) between components without having to explicityly pass a prop through every level of the tree. It helps to avoid prop-drilling(passing data from parent to child components) by providing what would be considered "global" data for a React component tree/section of a tree.

2. In your own words, describe `actions`, `reducers` and the `store` and their role in Redux. What does each piece do? Why is the store known as a 'single source of truth' in a redux application?
   --->Store is an object that holds the whole centralized state of the entire React application. We can change the state in the store with actions. Actions dispatch enact these changes when triggered by a reducer. A reducer is the logic inside the state store & acts like an event listener to decide what the new state should be. When a certain event is triggered, the reducer will in turn trigger an action, which will activate a dispatch to do some kind of process which will put data into its payload, then the reducer will take the payload data to update the state.

3. What is the difference between Application state and Component state? When would be a good time to use one over the other?
   ---> Application state refers to global state and Component state is local state. If the a component's state is not being used by any other component, then there is no need to set up a state management system. If there are several forms of state being used by several different generations of React components, then it's best to set up a state management system. The larger the scale of the application, the greater the need for global state management.

4. Describe `redux-thunk`, what does it allow us to do? How does it change our `action-creators`?
   ---> redux-thunk is middleware that allows a coder to write asynchronous logic. Basically, it allows us to write code that can dispatch actions while keeping that logic separate from the UI.

5. What is your favorite state management system you've learned and this sprint? Please explain why!
   ---> Redux is an incredibly powerful & versitile tool but Context API is my favorite state management that I've learned so far. It is easy to use, easy to understand and a simple way to prevent prop-drill. It does have its short-comings though. It only provides state, it does not manage it like Redux can. It also makes re-using components more difficult. If I have a component tree using context api to manage its state and I want to move a component outside of the tree to use elsewhere, I will have to set up another way to manage state so that the moved/copied component receives the correct props.

You are expected to be able to answer questions in these areas. Your responses contribute to your Sprint Challenge grade.

## Instructions

### Task 1: Project Set Up

- [ ] `fork & clone` this repository.
- [ ] `cd` into the forked copy of this repository.

**Setting up the CodeGrade webhook**

Go [here](./CodeGrade-webhook.md) to setup the CodeGrade webhook before you begin.

#### Setup Client Code

- [x] **LOOK** at your `src` directory and notice it's just a plain ol' React App that we've built using `create-react-app`.
- [x] **RUN** `npm install` to retrieve all `client-side` the dependencies.
- [x] **RUN** `npm start` to fire up your React application. There ought to be a pretty little message awaiting you welcoming you to the app. `Follow` the prompting.

**LOOK** at all the files you've been given for this project. Note that you will be interacting with an api during this project. Below is documentation on how to interact with the **API**.

#### Resource: API documentation

##### GET '/smurfs'

- [x] Retrieve an array all the Smurfs in the Smurf DB by writing a `GET` to the endpoint `/smurfs`.
- [ ] Double check that your response from the server is an array of smurfs.

```js
[
  {
    id: 'eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9',
    name: 'Poppa Smurf',
    position: 'Village Leader',
    nickname: 'Pops',
    description:
      'Papa is the practical village leader and the father figure of 100 or so young Smurfs. He is easily identified by his red Smurf hat, pants, and a shortly-trimmed white beard and moustache.'
  }
];
```

##### POST '/smurfs'

- [ ] Design the functionality to add a smurf to the Smurf DB you'll need all five fields. `name`, `position`, and `nickname`, `description`.

Example of the shape of data to be sent to the `POST` endpoint. Note that id does not need to be sent and will be generated on the server:

```js
{
  name:'Poppa Smurf',
  position:'Village Leader',
  nickname: 'Pops',
  description: 'Papa is the practical village leader and the father figure of 100 or so young Smurfs. He is easily identified by his red Smurf hat, pants, and a shortly-trimmed white beard and moustache.'
}
```

- [ ] Double check to make sure that a smurf is created correctly once your functionality is built out.

Initially Brainey will be in the array, but it takes more than one smurf to make the village. Be sure to add a few smurfs to populate our smurf village.

**HINT** if you are going to be working on Stretch Problem, you'll need to use that unique `id`.

Example of object created in Smurf DB:

```js
[
  {
    name: 'Poppa Smurf',
    position: 'Village Leader',
    nickname: 'Pops',
    description:
      'Papa is the practical village leader and the father figure of 100 or so young Smurfs. He is easily identified by his red Smurf hat, pants, and a shortly-trimmed white beard and moustache.'
  },
  {
    id: 'JzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZ',
    name: 'Smurfette',
    position: 'Beautician',
    nickname: 'Smurfette',
    description:
      "Smurfette's role in the village is that of any other smurf; chores, and helping out where she can, but for her specifically, she is often seen to be very active in organizing events."
  }
];
```

### Task 2: Project Requirements

Your finished project must include all of the following requirements:

- [x] Plan and implement how you are going to manage your state for your application
- [x] You _must_ use Redux as your state management system
- [ ] Complete the tasks listed within:
      X* `./reducers/index.js`
      * `./actions/index.js`
      _ `./index.js`
      _ `./App.js`
      _ `./components/AddForm.js`
      _ `./components/Smurf.js` \* `./components/SmurfDisplay.js`
- [ ] You completed application should do the following: - Fetch and display data from the included server code on mounting. - Provide the user a form for adding in the Name, Position, Nickname and Description of a new Smurf. - Allow new smurfs to be added to the list when the submit smurf button is pressed. - Displays an error alert when name, position or nickname is not included in the submission. - Include the word "Error" and "name/position/nickname" in the rendered error alert as approprate. - Does NOT display an error alert when description is left blank. - Display an error alert if a smurf is submitted with a name already assigned to a smurf. - Include the word "Error" and the returned server error message in the rendered error alert as approprate. - DO NOT REMOVE ANY data-testid FIELDS FROM THE CODE. These fields are used for internal grading of your sprints. While we don't recommend using testid in most cases, it is necessary our grading systems currently.

In your solution, it is essential that you follow best practices and produce clean and professional results. You will be scored on your adherence to proper code style and good organization. Schedule time to review, refine, and assess your work and perform basic professional polishing including spell-checking and grammar-checking on your work. It is better to submit a challenge that meets MVP than one that attempts too much and does not.

### Task 3: Stretch Goals

After finishing your required elements, you can push your work further. These goals may or may not be things you have learned in this module but they build on the material you just studied. Time allowing, stretch your limits and see if you can deliver on the following optional goals:

- [ ] Build a smurf profile page with using react-router and dynamic url params
- [ ] Using React Testing Library, test one or more of your components (not any component that fetches data though)

## Submission format

Follow these steps for completing your project.

- [ ] Submit a Pull-Request to merge <firstName-lastName> Branch into master (student's Repo). **Please don't merge your own pull request**
